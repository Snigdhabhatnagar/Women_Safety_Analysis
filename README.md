## Installation     
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.   
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.     
      
## Motivation     
For this project, I was interestested in doing an analysis to study the trend in the most offensive crime against women â€œRape" to better understand:   
   
1) State wise trend in rape cases.

3) situation in last 8 years in particular states  
4) predict future years increase in cases

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
Other is a csv file where the data related to the project is compiled.
   
## Result
